        <h2> The Duchess of Padua </h2>
        <h3> ACT II.   _Room in the Dukeâ€™s Palace_ (36 _minutes_).
        </h3>
        <p>
            <br> _A state room in the Ducal Palace_,
            <br>
            <h5>DUKE</h5><br>

            <br>No, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!<br>
   Why, she is worse than ugly, she is good.<br>

   <br><h5>MAFFIO [_excitedly_]</h5>><br>

   <br>Your Grace, there are two thousand people there<br>
   Who every moment grow more clamorous.<br>

   <br><h5>DUKE</h5><br>

<br>Tut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs!<br>
   People who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;<br>
   The only men I fear are silent men.<br>

   <br> [_A yell from the people_.]<br>

                                               <br> You see, Lord Cardinal, how my people love me.<br>

                                               <br> [_Another yell_.]<br>

                                               <br>Go, Petrucci,<br>
   And tell the captain of the guard below<br>
   To clear the square.  Do you not hear me, sir?<br>
   Do what I bid you.<br>

   <br>   [_Exit_ PETRUCCI.]<br>

   <br><h5>CARDINAL</h5><br>

   <br> I beseech your Grace<br>
   To listen to their grievances.<br>

   <br><h5>DUKE [_sitting on his throne_]</h5><br>

   <br> Ay! the peaches<br>
    Are not so big this year as they were last.<br>
    I crave your pardon, my lord Cardinal,<br>
    I thought you spake of peaches.<br>

    <br> [_A cheer from the people_.]<br>

                                              <br> What is that?<br>

                                              <br>GUIDO [_rushes to the window_]<br>

                                              <br> The Duchess has gone forth into the square,<br>
   And stands between the people and the guard,<br>
   And will not let them shoot.<br>
