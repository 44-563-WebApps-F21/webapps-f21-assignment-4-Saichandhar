        <h2> The Duchess of Padua </h2>
        <h3> ACT II.   _Room in the Dukeâ€™s Palace_ (36 _minutes_).
        </h3>
        <p>
            <br> _A state room in the Ducal Palace_,
            <br>
            DUKE

   No, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!
   Why, she is worse than ugly, she is good.<br>

MAFFIO [_excitedly_]

   Your Grace, there are two thousand people there
   Who every moment grow more clamorous.<br>

DUKE

   Tut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs!
   People who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;
   The only men I fear are silent men.<br>

                                               [_A yell from the people_.]

   You see, Lord Cardinal, how my people love me.<br>

                                                         [_Another yell_.]

   Go, Petrucci,
   And tell the captain of the guard below
   To clear the square.  Do you not hear me, sir?
   Do what I bid you.<br>

                                                        [_Exit_ PETRUCCI.]

CARDINAL

   I beseech your Grace
   To listen to their grievances.<br>

DUKE [_sitting on his throne_]

   Ay! the peaches
   Are not so big this year as they were last.
   I crave your pardon, my lord Cardinal,
   I thought you spake of peaches.

                                              [_A cheer from the people_.]

   What is that?<br>

GUIDO [_rushes to the window_]

   The Duchess has gone forth into the square,
   And stands between the people and the guard,
   And will not let them shoot.<br>
