            <h5 class= "name">DUKE</h5>
          <p class="speech">No, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!
   Why, she is worse than ugly, she is good.</p>

   <br><h5 class="name">MAFFIO</h5> <p class="stage-direction"> [_excitedly_]</p>

   <p class="speech">Your Grace, there are two thousand people there
   Who every moment grow more clamorous.</p>

   <br><h5 class="name">DUKE</h5>

   <p class= "speech">Tut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs! People who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;
   The only men I fear are silent men.

   </p><p class=stage-direction>[_A yell from the people_.]</p>

                                               <p class=speech> You see, Lord Cardinal, how my people love me.</p>

                                               <p class=stage-diection> [_Another yell_.]</p>

                                               <p class=speech>Go, Petrucci,
   And tell the captain of the guard below
   To clear the square.  Do you not hear me, sir?
   Do what I bid you.

      </p><p class=stage-direction>[_Exit_ PETRUCCI.]</p>

   <br><h5 class=name>CARDINAL</h5>

   <p class=speech>I beseech your Grace
   To listen to their grievances.</p>

   <br><h5 class=name>DUKE </h5><p class=stage-direction>[_sitting on his throne_]</p>

    <p class=speech>Ay! the peaches
    Are not so big this year as they were last.
    I crave your pardon, my lord Cardinal,
    I thought you spake of peaches.</p>

     <p class=stage-direction>[_A cheer from the people_.]</p>

                                              <p class="speech"> What is that?</p>

                                              <br><h5 class="name">GUIDO </h5>
                                              <p class="stage-direction">[_rushes to the window_]</p>

                                              <p class="speech">The Duchess has gone forth into the square,
   And stands between the people and the guard,
   And will not let them shoot.</p>
