        <h2> The Duchess of Padua </h2>
        <h3> ACT II.   _Room in the Dukeâ€™s Palace_ (36 _minutes_).
        </h3>
        <p>
            <br> _A state room in the Ducal Palace_,
            <br>
            <h5>DUKE</h5>
          <p>No, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!
   Why, she is worse than ugly, she is good.</p>

   <br><h5>MAFFIO</h5> <p> [_excitedly_]</p>

   <p>Your Grace, there are two thousand people there
   Who every moment grow more clamorous.</p>

   <br><h5>DUKE</h5>

   <p>Tut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs! People who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;
   The only men I fear are silent men.

   </p><p>[_A yell from the people_.]</p>

                                               <p> You see, Lord Cardinal, how my people love me.

                                                [_Another yell_.]

                                               Go, Petrucci,
   And tell the captain of the guard below
   To clear the square.  Do you not hear me, sir?
   Do what I bid you.

      </p><p>[_Exit_ PETRUCCI.]</p>

   <br><h5>CARDINAL</h5>

   <p>I beseech your Grace
   To listen to their grievances.</p>

   <br><h5>DUKE </h5><p>[_sitting on his throne_]</p>

    <p>Ay! the peaches
    Are not so big this year as they were last.
    I crave your pardon, my lord Cardinal,
    I thought you spake of peaches.</p>

     <p>[_A cheer from the people_.]</p>

                                              <p> What is that?</p>

                                              <br><h5>GUIDO </h5><p>[_rushes to the window_]</p>

                                              <p>The Duchess has gone forth into the square,
   And stands between the people and the guard,
   And will not let them shoot.</p>
